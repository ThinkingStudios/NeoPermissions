# :key: NeoPermissions

A simple permissions API for NeoForge. It allows mods to easily run permission checks and lookup option (metadata) values against permission providers.

If you want to configure permissions, you will also need to install a compatible permission manager mod.

* Downloads can be found under the [Releases](https://github.com/ThinkingStudios/NeoPermissions/releases) tab.
* Usage information for mod developers can be found in the [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) file.

Enjoy!
